Title: Stability Analysis of K-Means Clustering
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Wolfgang Brightenburg
Maintainer: Wolfgang Brightenburg <wolfgangkbri@tamu.edu>
Description: This package is designed for a small simulation study
    comparing the efficacy of a slew of stability metric methods for selecting K
    in K-means clustering. This package implements the cannon metrics, Minimum 
    Matching Distance and Co-membership distance, along with three novel metrics 
    based on the Wasserstein distance of various components of the clusterings.
